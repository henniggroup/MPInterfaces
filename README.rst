MPinterfaces is a python package that enables high throughput Density
Functional Theory(DFT) analysis of arbitrary material interfaces(two dimensional
materials, hetero-structure, ligand capped
nanoparticles and surfaces in the presence of solvents) using
VASP_, VASPsol_, LAMMPS_, materialsproject_ database
as well as their open source tools_ and a little bit of ase_.

Installation
==============

Prepping - Setting up Virtual Environments with Miniconda
===========================================================

We recommend setting up virtual environment
using Miniconda which can be installed according to their instructions from https://conda.io/miniconda.html

Note for SuperComputer Clusters with Linux OS:
==============================================

HiperGator2 and other linux based supercomputing clusters
have shared modules one of which are the C++ modules under gcc.
This needs to be loaded before any of the aforementioned
gcc/5.2.0 has all the shared libraries
required for a successful installation.

Do the following on HiperGator2 before you create
the Miniconda environment:

$ module purge
$ module load gcc/5.2.0

Follow the following steps to set up virtual environment using Miniconda

$ conda create -n name_of_your_environment python=3.6

On Mac OS and Linux

$ source activate name_of_your_environment

$ conda install numpy scipy matplotlib ipython

On Windows:

$ activate name_of_your_environment

$ conda install numpy scipy matplotlib ipython

Installing Pymatgen
====================

$ conda install -c matsci pymatgen

Note: You will need to have C++ libraries properly
installed for the package to install correctly on Windows.

Note: If this does not work, see http://pymatgen.org/#getting-pymatgen

Installing MPInterfaces from GitHub
=====================================

If you would like to get the latest updates, or develop and contribute we recommend getting the bleeding edge
copy from the github repository.

If you already have a local copy, steps 1 and 2 of the following instructions
can be skipped. Just do a "git pull" from the MPInterfaces folder and go to
step 3(if the local copy was installed in the develop mode this step can be skipped too).

Note: on using virtual environments on your own machine, we recommend to use Miniconda.

1. Clone the latest version from github

  - git clone https://github.com/henniggroup/MPInterfaces.git

2. cd MPInterfaces

3. python setup.py install(or develop)

4. Copy the mpint_config.yaml file from config_files/mpint_config.yaml
   to ~/mpint_config.yaml
   and update the file so that you at least have the following
   environment variables :

   - PMG_MAPI_KEY=the_key_obtained_from_materialsproject

   - PMG_VASP_PSP_DIR=path_to_vasp_potcar_files


For teaching and demo purposes, we recommend using Microsoft Azure notebooks,
an example of which is at https://notebooks.azure.com/JoshGabriel92/libraries/PourbaixCourse
which contains two notebooks that illustrate installing pymatgen and pyhull for on the fly
data science tutorials. We have one notebook FeOH_Example.ipynb for Pourbaix diagrams and an MPInterfacesDemo that illustrate other features of the MPInterfaces code with more to come.



Installing MPInterfaces from PyPI
==================================

Once you have a nicely prepped virtual environment with miniconda
and you do not seek to do extensive code development/contributions,
we recommend installing from PyPI with:

$ pip install MPInterfaces_Latest


Documentation
==============

A very minimal documentation is avaiable at

http://henniggroup.github.io/MPInterfaces/

and work is underway to improve it.


Usage
==========

We use pymatgen tools for all structure manipulation tasks, so it would
be a good idea to start from here:

http://pymatgen.org/#using-pymatgen

The examples folder contain some sample scripts that demonstrate the
usage of mpinterfaces as well as materialsproject packages. For basic
usage please see **docs/usage.rst**.
